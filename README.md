# hiperglm: High-Performance GLM Package

## Overview

`hiperglm` is an R package that provides a high-performance implementation of Generalized Linear Models (GLM). This package is designed to efficiently fit GLMs, and it exports a set of functions for model fitting, coefficient extraction, variance-covariance matrix computation, and model printing.

## Installation

You can install the `hiperglm` package from GitHub using the `devtools` package:

```R
devtools::install_github("yourusername/hiperglm")
```

# Usage

## Model Fitting

Use the hiper_glm function for fitting high-performance GLMs:

```R
library(hiperglm)

# Example data
design <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 5), ncol = 5)
outcome <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.5)

# Fit the high-performance GLM
model <- hiper_glm(design, outcome)
```R
